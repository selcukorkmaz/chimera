Description: Tools to integrate and model multiple biomedical data modalities 
  (omics, medical images, clinical text, structured metadata) with unified preprocessing, fusion strategies (early/late/hybrid), machine learning via tidymodels, and explainability using DALEX. The MVP focuses on numeric/omics, tabular clinical, and text (TFâ€“IDF) with a lightweight image feature stub; richer encoders (e.g., CNNs) can be plugged later.
